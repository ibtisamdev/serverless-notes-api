## Introduction

The Serverless Notes API is a serverless application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. It is designed to be highly scalable and cost-effective by leveraging AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and AWS DynamoDB.

Key features of this API include:
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to manage their notes.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete notes.
- **Security**: Data is stored securely, and user access is authenticated and authorized.
- **Scalability**: The serverless architecture scales automatically based on demand.

This repository contains the source code and configuration for deploying the Serverless Notes API on your AWS environment.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and services are used in this project:

- **Serverless Framework**: This framework simplifies the deployment and management of serverless applications on AWS.
- **AWS Lambda**: For executing serverless functions.
- **AWS API Gateway**: To create and manage the API endpoints.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing notes.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Used for user authentication and management.
- **Node.js**: The serverless functions are written in JavaScript using Node.js.

## Setup Project

To set up and deploy this project on your AWS environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serverless-notes-api.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   cd serverless-notes-api
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   If you haven't already, configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

4. **AWS Cognito Setup**
   - Set up an Amazon Cognito user pool and configure it in the `serverless.yml` file.

5. **Serverless Framework Setup**
   - Update the `serverless.yml` file with your own AWS resource names and configurations.
   - Customize the environment variables in the `serverless.env.yml` file to suit your needs.

6. **Deploy the Application**
   ```
   serverless deploy
   ```

7. **Testing**
   Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints. The API Gateway URL will be displayed in the console after deployment.

## Usage

To use the Serverless Notes API, you can create an account or log in using the provided endpoints. Once authenticated, you can create, read, update, and delete notes using the API endpoints.

Example API endpoints:
- `POST /notes` - Create a new note.
- `GET /notes/{noteId}` - Read a specific note.
- `PUT /notes/{noteId}` - Update a note.
- `DELETE /notes/{noteId}` - Delete a note.

Make sure to include the authentication token in the request headers to access protected endpoints.

## Deployment

This project can be easily deployed to your AWS environment using the Serverless Framework. Follow the setup steps mentioned above and use `serverless deploy` to deploy the application.
